# The math papers I read

Pre work for an aspiring mathematician before getting into college.

The main idea behind this repo is to hold a list of all the papers I read before being accepted and start a carreer as a mathematician. Every month from here until Aug '22 I'll post at least one paper I read and a summary of what I understood. This will serve as practice and to be better versed before applying to the university.

## Sources

Mainly, I will use Papers We Love repository here on Github but maybe I'll find another source.
